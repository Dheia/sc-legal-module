## Transparency üì¢

This project is completely transparent and honest, before we started we contacted and discussed this project with the authors and admins of the October project. We have given the links to this repo to the authors and we continue to want to be transparent throughout the whole process! We feel it's important to state this and be open. This repo is made up of one module, which is part of several other modules all dedicated to different sections of an Summer CMS proposal. Instead of writing ideas and suggestions, we have taken a pro-active approach and are actively coding a fully working solution. The code is held on private repo's because the code is being heavily developed and changed on a daily basis. We will release a stable release to the admins and authors in private for feedback before releasing to the general public. This is a long-term project and will continue to grow!

Over years we have coded and created well over a hundred pull requests (under various github accounts) which have been merged to the October version one projects core, we have never asked or recevived any money for any of the pull requests. We use the cms for professional purposes and therefore it is beneficial for our companies to have a professional working solution to give our end-users and clients. In order for us to delivery a high quality product we made the discussion to update the cms as there have been a lot of new api's, frameworks, libraries  and technologies been added to the internet over the years since the initial release of the cms.

## Introduction :star:

There are lots of many mediocre projects trying to tackle this subject and use either insecure cookies or dont even pass ePrivacy and GDPR laws properly. Laravel is a wonderful framework and we have built all the tools directly into the Summer CMS framework for developers and webmasters to easily create all their legal web pages for their websites and apps. Everything is fully customizable and takes very little time to setup.

The legal module has been fully optimized to work with `Desktop`, `Mobile`, `DPWA`, `PWA`, `AMP-HTML` and `AMP-HTML Stories`.

(*) More platforms will be added in the near future.

## Naming Prefix ‚úíÔ∏è

**Summer CMS uses the `sc-` naming prefix to advoid conflicts.**

## Requirements üö©

**A full list of requirements to install Summer CMS, can be found here: [Summer CMS Requirements](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-main/blob/main/README.md#requirements-).**

## Machine Learning :computer:

This module uses machine learning to help speed up creating the legal pages for your website / app and uses custom json datasets.

## Citation üìö

Click the above badge for more information regarding the complete citation for this legal module and the diffferent citation formats like: IEEE, APA, BibTeX, CSL, DataCite, Dublin Core, DCAT, JSON, JSON-LD, GeoJSON, MARCXML and Mendeley etc.

## API's :gem:

- Javascript uses **Trusted Types API** to prevent DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Also the **MutationObserver API** to update the machine learning DOM nodes.

==== TO DO ===




## Goals :soccer:

The legal module makes it easier to create and manage with custom built tools for the following:

- 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Notice
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Cookie Policy
- Copyright Notification
- Copyscape Plagiarism Policy
- Creative Commons License
- Data Protection Officer (DPO)
- Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
- ePrivacy
- EU Representative
- EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks
- GDPR
- Guidelines for Law Enforcement
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Master Services Agreement (MSA)
- Opt-In Policy
- Opt-Out Policy
- Privacy Policy
- Push Notification Policy
- Spam Abuse
- Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks
- Terms and Conditions

## Privacy Controls :sparkles:

This module allows the website / app's external users to have full control of their privacy policies giving them all the correct infomation and controls to adjust their settings they way they want. The developer is given easy to use tools to setup the privacy controls, using a simple wrapper method on sections of code they wish to allow the end-users to be able to control. Webmasters can setup their privacy in no time at all, without needing to write any code at all, using the module's custom tools and be able to preview everything in the backend, without needing to switch to the frontend to preview the end result.

## Troubleshooting üëø

### Something üíä

=== TO DO ===


## Reporting a Vulnerability üí•

We strive to make the code accessible to a wide audience of beginner and experienced users.

We welcome bug reports, false positive alert reports, evasions, usability issues, and suggestions for new detections. Submit these types of non-vulnerability related issues via Github.

Please include your installed version and the relevant portions of your audit log.

False negative or common bypasses should [create an issue](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-legal-module/issues/new) so they can be addressed.

Do this before submitting a vulnerability:

1) Verify that you have the latest version of Summer CMS.
2) Validate which Paranoia Level this bypass applies to. If it works in PL4, please send us an email.
3) If you detected anything that causes unexpected behavior of the engine via manipulation of existing provided rules, please send it by email.

We are happy to work with the community to provide CVE identifiers for any discovered security issues if requested.

If in doubt, feel free to reach out to us!

## Code of Conduct üíØ

In order to ensure that the Summer CMS proposal community is welcoming to all, please review and abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-legal-module/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Notes

(1) Microsoft announced on 17 August that Edge Legacy will have its life support switched off on 9 March 2021, Summer CMS will support Edge Chromium only.

(2) Internet Explorer version 1-11, Summer CMS will not support due to only supporting `Evergreen` brwosers.

For a full list of browser support with Summer CMS, see here: [Browser Support](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-main/blob/main/docs/browser_support.md).

## Changelog üèÜ

Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information what has changed recently.

## Contributions, Feature Requests and Feedback ‚ú®

We are actively inviting new contributors! To start, please read the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This project is only possible thanks to the work of many dedicated volunteers. Everyone is encouraged to help in ways large and small. Here are a few ways you can help:

- Read the current content and help us fix any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors.

**Note:** Please use Unit Testing and Coding Best Practices in order to have a valid pull request üòâ

Patches and pull requests are encouraged. All code should follow the [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) style guidelines. **Please include unit tests whenever possible!**

### PSR ‚ôªÔ∏è

This legal module uses some PSR standards to be the most interoperable possible:

- [PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) Caching Interface.
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Standard interfaces to represent http requests, responses and uris.
- [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) Standard factories to create PSR-7 objects.
- [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) Standard interface to send a http request and return a response.

We also suggest using Cross-browser testing provided by BrowserStack (*) where a real-browser can't be used in-house.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/oc-security-module/blob/master/src/assets/images/browser-stack.png"></p>

## Semantic Versioning ‚úÖ

The legal Module code uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

We have two types of releases, Major releases (3.0.0, 3.1.0, 3.2.0 etc.) and point releases (3.0.1, 3.0.2 etc.).

We officially support the two point releases with security patching preceding the current major release.

We are happy to receive and merge PR's that address security issues in older versions of the project, but the team itself may choose not to fix these.

Along those lines, the team may not issue security notifications for unsupported software.

| Version     | Supported          |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 3.3.x-dev   | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.3.x-rc    | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.3.x-beta  | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.3.x-aplha | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.2.x       | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.1.x       | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.x       | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.x.x     | :x:                |

When the version tag is not stable; e.g. `1.0.0-alpha`, `1.0.0-beta`, `1.0.0-dev` or `1.0.0-rc` (see https://semver.org/#spec-item-11)
